1. break Statement:
The break statement exits a loop (or a switch statement) entirely. Once break is encountered, control immediately moves to the next statement after the loop.


2. continue Statement:
The continue statement skips the current iteration of the loop and moves directly to the next iteration. It doesnâ€™t exit the loop but bypasses any code following the continue statement for that iteration.




for loop --------------------------------

for(initalisation,condition,increment){

}



while loop -----------------------------


initialiser
while(condition){

code to be executed

increment

}



do while loop --------------------------
